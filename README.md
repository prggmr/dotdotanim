dotdotanim
==========

Example

http://jsfiddle.net/63rHc/

Simple ... JS animation.

Creates a "." ".." "..." animation transition for a simple loader that doesn't spin.

To use include the script somewhere and call ```$('.some-element').dotdotanim('Loading Something')```.

Once the the content in ```$('.some-element')``` is replaced the loader automatically stops.

That's it!

HAVE FUN!
